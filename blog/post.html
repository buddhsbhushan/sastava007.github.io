          <p>In this era of internet there is continuous connectivity between people and constant exchange of knowledge and wisdom all around. I just want to be a tiny part of it to be able to make a big change in the society someday.</p>

          <p>On multiple ocassions I searched the internet to find roadmap for learning different skills in multiple disciplines of computer science. This kind of exposure is really important for a freshman in college who are often confused by the overwhelmingly large number of disciplines in Computer Science. There is really big confusion in deciding what they should do in their college and on what topics should they invest most of their time. In this post I'll discuss what's the best way to spend your time <b>according to me</b> so that at the end of the freshmen year you are not left with any "I should have..."</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">1. Switch to Linux</h2>

          <p>This is the first thing you should do after joining college, if you really want to learn and explore the stuff then make some sacrifice of windows interface and shift to a less attractive but powerful Ubuntu. You can get started with it by dual booting your machine with Ubuntu.</p>

          <!-- <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote> -->

          <h2 class="section-heading">2. Learn a Programming language</h2>

          <p>Start with a basic programming language, it can be either C or C++(suggested). No matter how outdated you think these languages are but once you have gained a good fundamental knowledge of these languages you can easily shift to high level languages like Python or Java. Don't wait for your profs. to start teaching (bcoz they never gonna do), there are already lots of <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming_tutorials.htm" target="blank" class="post-link">resources</a> available online which you can use to get started with.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">3. Start solving problems</h2>
          <p>Now when you have understood the basic fundamentals of a language, it's time to start solving problems in it. Get yourself registered on an online judge preferably <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="blank" class="post-link">Hackerrank</a> and start solving basic implementation problems.</p><p>By this time you'll notice that why native CPP is not sufficient to solve problems on OJs so it's time to master STL through <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/power-up-c-with-the-standard-template-library-part-1/" target="blank" class="post-link">Topcoder tutorials</a>. Once you have gained enough confidence in solving problems shift to <a class="post-link" href="https://www.hackerearth.com" target="blank">Hackerearth</a> or <a class="post-link" href="https://www.codechef.com" target="blank">Codechef</a> and start participating in online constests.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">4. Build some Projects</h2>
          <p>The best way to master any programming language is by doing some real life projects in it. If you are from CPP/Python background then you can try learning OpenCV library for image processing and make some really cool projects with it. Here's a list of some <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-science-projects/#C++" target="_blank" class="post-link">amazing projects </a>which you can try with OpenCV.</p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">5. Learn about GIT</h2>
          <p>Learning git is the next most important thing. GIT is a version control system that helps you maintain your codebase properly. As for now you can consider GIT as your google drive where you can place your code but it also helps to keep track of the commits which you made to your codebase from time to time. Till now you have developed a project and solved problems, so it's time to start pushing (uploading) your code to <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank" class="post-link">Github </a>so that other people can also see and contribute to your projects. A really simple tutorial can be found <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/" target="_blank" class="post-link">here </a> You don't need to learn them all just couple of commands are enough to get your work done.</p>          
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/github.png" alt="Github Commit Graph">
          <span class="caption text-muted">Make your Github commit graph green like a forest</span>

          <h2 class="section-heading">6. Explore different disciplines</h2>
          <p> It is time to explore all the different ideas and topics that make up computer science so interesting. If you have followed all the steps till here properly then you must have gained enough skills to implement any idea in code without much efforts. You  You can have a look at some of the most popular oneâ€“
              <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <ul>
                  <li>Web Development</li>
                  <li>Image Processing</li>
                  <li>Mobile application development</li>
                  <li>Data Science (not suggested for a freshman, becz for this you should have enough knowledge of CS fundamentals)</li>
                </ul>
              </blockquote>
              Learn about them and build at least 2-3 projects around the domain you find interesting which you can showcase in your portfolio.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">7. Contribute to Open Source projects</h2>
          <p>By this time you have gained enough skills to start contributing to open source projects. Explore github and find project which matches your interest, read their documentation and look if you can fix some issues or add a new feature to it. Always remember no contribution is small, even if you fix some </p>
